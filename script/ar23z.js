This has clearly been seen with the Google search engine itself over the last few years and it should be of no surprise as this happens with AdSense. Advertisers will appear in more appropriate results and those advertisers who manipulate their content to allow high paying keywords to appear may struggle to do this unless it is actually appropriate to their content.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother thing which is bound to happen is more protection for AdWords advertisers concerning click fraud. Google acknowledges this to be a very key issue that it needs to address as quickly as possible and there's no doubt it will happen as fast as possible. At the moment those who have high levels of traffic, can easily disguise IP addresses and increase CTR ( Click Through Rate).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGoogle is always keen on improving its products and this has been seen before in AdSense. The search engine company has introduced site-targeted AdSense CPM, \"smart pricing\" and domain blocking and there will probably be improvements that have already been added by other similar sites.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne such example is the option for the advertiser to have more control over where the content is being displayed. This could mean blocking your site from displaying on several addresses that host AdSense banners.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother idea that has been advanced is that Google will integrate AdSense in other forms of media like newspapers or television and so on. While this might seem to be more on the science-fiction side of the facts there's no indication that this might not happen. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGoogle have access to an international array of over 150,000 advertisers of whom may choose to penetrate offline markets in different countries. With Google’s strong network of advertisers, they may choose to appoint or allow offline distributors to create a format for Adwords advertising in content, in search and now offline. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMore options could be implemented for AdSense publishers, allowing them to specify keywords of their own. While Google has been reluctant of this there's no indication that this will not happen in the future.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlso, a lot of people are demanding a clear specification of the pricing policy of AdSense. Google has given no indication of why this isn't public information but at this moment it seems highly unlikely that such information will ever be present on Google AdSense.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother feature that could find itself into AdSense would be letting website publishers see which links are generating clicks on their website and based on what keywords they arrive there.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis could end up being a major issue that could threaten the entire system as it could perhaps encourage more adsense only websites as profits become more transparent. A lot of people may make AdSense-only sites, designed just for making profits through AdSense.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhile this is already happening today, it might be foolish of Google to put such tools in the hands of its publishers.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever, one thing that could happen is a way for users to fix their issues with low AdSense generated income on their site. This could be done through an on-line wizard or something similar that would make suggestions to website owners based on their contents.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut the major buzzword of the day is RSS. The possibility of sending targeted ads directly to users without requiring any navigation on their behalf is becoming a reality with RSS. And there are clear signs that Google isn't going to let such an opportunity pass by.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is what \"interactive television\" and similar items have been trying to do for quite some time now. But the Internet would be a much better medium for this, because there are no mediums quite as interactive as the Internet.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut in the end, this is mostly speculation and we are bound to have Google surprising us with new features we would have never thought of."},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/1142813826673414409"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/1142813826673414409"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https://ar23z.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-future-of-google-adsense.html","title":"The Future of Google Adsense"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Admin"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"35","height":"35","src":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA\u003ds35"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1674710821049047417.post-7479959031283381461"},"published":{"$t":"2018-10-26T19:59:00.000+07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2019-04-22T18:57:48.331+07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Review"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Optimizing Your Blog for Search Engines"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"Bloggers who are interested in building high traffic to their blog and maintaining a successful blog should pay particular attention to search engine optimization techniques which can help to improve the search engine rankings of their blogs. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSearch engines all employ some type of ranking algorithm which is used to determine the order in which websites are returned when an Internet user searches for information on a particular topic. However, not all search engines use the same algorithm for this purpose. As a result there is no simple solution to optimizing a blog for high rankings on all search engines. There are a few tips though which can be useful with most search engines. These tips include using relevant keywords, generating back links to your blogs and using image tags in a beneficial way. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe Importance of Keywords\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe use of relevant keywords in blog posts is one of the most common and also one of the simplest ways to optimize search engine rankings. However, not all bloggers agree on the best ways to use relevant keywords to optimize search engine rankings. Some bloggers believe keywords must be used often to create high keyword densities while others believe using keywords at lower densities of 1%-3% and paying attention to placement of the keywords is the most worthwhile strategy. Still other bloggers argue that simply using relevant keywords as they come naturally in the flow of the blog posts is sufficient to ensure search engines understand the content of the blog. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRegardless of the keyword strategy a blogger opts to employ all bloggers can benefit from researching relevant keywords. They may have a blog which pertains to a general subject such as gardening but may not be aware of the search terms typically used by Internet users when researching this subject. Fortunately there are many programs available which generate related keywords for a particular time which provides the blogger with other keywords they should consider incorporating into the blog. For the example of a blog pertaining to gardening the blogger may want to use additional keywords such as container gardening or home gardening to attract more interest from search engine users. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGenerating Favorable Back Links\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBack links are also another common factor used in search engine ranking algorithms. Many search engines consider the number of back links pointing to a website as well as the quality of the websites which provide these back links. This means the search engine rankings of the website which points to your blog could influence the amount of weight the back link contributes to your own rankings. This is because some search engines consider higher ranking websites to be more valuable than other websites which do not rank well and therefore reward websites receiving back links from these high ranking websites quite favorably. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSome search engine algorithms also consider whether or not the back links are reciprocated or not reciprocated. In these cases non reciprocal links are usually considered to be more valuable than reciprocal links. Also, back links which come from link exchanges or link farms are typically not considered to be very influential to search engine rankings. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHow Images Can Improve Search Engine Rankings\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBloggers should also be aware that any pictures used on their blog can be used to improve search engine rankings with some search engines. This aspect of search engine optimization is often overlooked because many bloggers believe the pictures are not viewed by search engines. While this is true the search engines do crawl the code of the blog in addition to the content on the blog. This means the search engine will view the information provided in the image tags. Bloggers can take advantage of this by using the image tags to provide relevant keywords which can bolster search engine rankings. However, care should be taken to ensure the keywords used in these tags also accurately describe the image because blog visitors will often see the text included in these tags when they scroll over a picture on the blog.

However, maintaining a successful blog is a far more difficult process. This is because there are so many different factors which can contribute to the success of a blog. Some of these factors include the subject of the blog, the popularity of the blog and even the aesthetic layout of the blog. Additionally, the ability to properly promote the blog and reach a large audience of interested Internet users will also have a profound impact on the success of a blog. Although there is no one simple formula for creating and maintaining a successful blog, there are some basic tips which can help to ensure a blogger will enjoy success with his blog. This article will outline some of these basic tips including posting new entries regularly, writing for a specific audience and properly evaluating changes made to the blog. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePosting New Blog Entries Regularly\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe importance of posting new blog entries on a regular basis cannot be underestimated. This is so important because regular postings offer dedicated blog visitors an incentive to keep returning to the blog. Readers may visit a blog originally by chance but become committed to returning to the blog regularly based on the content which is provided on a regular basis. If the blogger allows the blog to become stagnant, the readers do not have motivation to keep coming back to the blog. However, if there are new posts on a regular basis, visitors are likely to return to the blog often in anticipation of new postings. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe length as well as the depth of a blog post can vary considerably based on the subject of the blog and the expectations of the target audience. However, in many cases even a relatively short blog entry offering only a small amount of information may be enough to keep readers interested. This can be useful when the blogger is unable to provide in depth posts but in the long run, blog readers are looking for a certain degree of sustenance and will likely expect the blog to be updated with new posts regularly. Furthermore they will come to expect a certain voice and quality to the blog posts so bloggers who enlist the use of guest bloggers should carefully screen guest bloggers to ensure they are capable of posting blogs the audience will appreciate. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUnderstanding the Blog Audience\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSuccessful bloggers should also be adept at understanding the blog audience. Most successful blogs focus on a rather exclusive niche which draws a unique set of visitors. By keeping the information posted in the blog related to this niche, the blogger helps to ensure the audience will remain interested in the blog. However, the subject matter is not the only important aspect related to understanding the target audience.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBloggers should also be well aware of the type of information the blog readers are seeking and the way in which they prefer to have the information provided. This is important because some blog readers may enjoy lengthy pieces while others may prefer posts which are brief and to the point. Still other blog visitors may prefer to have posts provided as bulleted points in an easy to read manner. Providing the information in a way in which the visitors can process the information easily is as important as providing quality information. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEvaluating Changes to the Blog\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, all successful bloggers know how to make changes to the blog carefully and evaluate the effects these changes have on blog traffic. This is critical because a blog which is already successful can be doomed to failure if the blogger makes a chance which is not appreciated by the dedicated visitors and does not address the concerns of the readers. To avoid this potential problem bloggers should be careful to only make one change at a time and to allow ample time to evaluate the effect the change has on website traffic as well as the comments from readers before deciding whether to reverse the change or make additional changes. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSimilarly a blog which is looking to increase website traffic can run into problems if they make too many changes and do not evaluate how these changes are affecting the blog’s traffic. A better strategy would be to make small changes one at a time and evaluate the effect of the change carefully before making more changes. This will help guide the blogger to produce a successful blog.

Reaching a large audience may be a priority for a number of different reasons. One of the obvious reasons to attempt to generate increased traffic to a blog is to generate a profit. Bloggers who rely on high blog traffic for their revenue are obviously interested in increasing traffic. However, bloggers who create their blog to promote a cause may also be interested in increasing traffic simply to allow their message to reach a larger audience. Regardless of the reason to want to increase traffic, one of the best ways to do this is by optimizing the blog for search engines. This article will discuss the importance of search engine rankings and offer tips for optimizing a blog. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhy Search Engine Rankings are Important\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe importance of high search engine rankings is they can contribute to increased Internet traffic to the blog. This is because Internet users who use search engines to find information on a particular topic are much more likely to visit websites which appear on the first page of the search results than they are to visit websites which appear on subsequent pages of the search results. The websites appearing on the first page of the results are likely to get the most traffic. However, Internet users are not likely to search through more than a page or two of the search results when looking for more information on a particular subject.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHigh search engine rankings essentially act as free advertisement for a blog or website. This is because many website users rely on popular search engines to assist them in finding useful information on the Internet. The search engines apply complex algorithms to evaluate websites and rank them accordingly for specific search terms. As a result Internet users put a great deal of value on the search results produced and trust these results to lead them to the best available websites relevant to the keywords they specified in the search. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTips for Optimizing a Blog for Search Engines\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOne of the most common ways to optimize a blog or website for search engines is through the use of relevant keywords. Specifically the practice of applying specific keyword densities to the content of the blog is a common search engine optimization tactic employed. Blog owners and others who attempt to optimize their websites do not always agree on the optimal density for keywords but many believe a percentage of approximately 2%-3% is appropriate. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother method for optimizing a search engine optimization is to place relevant keywords into the code of the website. This includes the title tags and META tags. This is important because search engines often consider the prominence of keywords when evaluating a website. This refers to the location in which the keywords first appear. Placing keywords early in the content of the website is helpful but it is important to note the search engines view the code first so keywords appearing before the body of the blog will be crawled first by the search engines. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBlog owners can also help to increase their search engine rankings by generating back links to their blog. This can be accomplished in a number of different ways. One way to do this is to find other websites willing to place a link to the blog on their website. This is beneficial because many search engines factor the number of links to a website into their ranking algorithm because these links are considered to be one website vouching for the validity of another website. Some website owners may be willing to do this in return for a link to their website on your blog. This is known as reciprocal linking and some search engines may not value this link as highly as a link which is not reciprocated. There are also some link exchange programs but these links may not be beneficial because many search engines consider the rank of the website linking to your blog. Therefore, if the website linking to your blog does not rank well, the back link will not improve search engine rankings significantly.

Selecting a software package does not have to be difficult though. Bloggers can find websites which provide comparison charts for different software packages to simply the decision making process. These charts can save the blogger a great deal of time and effort because they compile a wealth of information into one convenient location. The blogger may still need some additional information before using these comparison charts to make a decision. The article will provide insight into some of this additional information which may be useful such as how to understand the comparison charts, methods for comparing the software packages and tips on selecting a blogging software package. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBlogging Software Criteria \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThose interested in starting or maintaining a blog should fully understand the blogging software criteria before attempting to compare software packages. Some of the criteria it is important to understand include the minimum server requirements, data storage and the post editor. Understanding these criteria is critical to the process of comparing and selecting blogging software packages. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe minimum server requirements refers to the minimum requirements for the server on which the software is to be installed. In most cases the power and speed of the server is not relevant but instead it depends on the power and speed of the software necessary for the proper operation of the blog software. There may be additional costs associated with this software as well as additional license requirements.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eData storage is also an important part of evaluating blogging software packages. This may include options such as a flat file, a data file or a database. A flat file refers to storage options in which the full page is pulled each time the blog is requested by a browser. A data file refers to situations in which the data for the blog is inserted into a template when the blog is requested by a browser. A database refers to storage options in which the necessary information is pulled from a flat file and inserted into a template when the blog is requested by a browser. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe post editor is another criterion a blogger may want to investigate carefully before selecting blogging software. The post editor refers to the type of editor which will be used to fill in the posts listed on the blog. These data entry methods may include options such as HTML or JAVA. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eComparing Blogging Software Packages\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBloggers who are seeking a blogging software package should carefully compare the different software packages available. This is important because obviously some software packages are superior to others. It is also important because some software packages may be better suited for the needs of a particular blog than other packages. When comparing blogging software packages it is important for the blogger to first carefully consider the needs of the blog. This is important because it will help the blogger to realize which criterion is most relevant to his particular blog. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSelecting Blogging Software Packages\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter carefully evaluating blogging software packages, it is time for the blogger to make a decision and select one of the available packages. Ideally the blogger will have already compared important data such as storage space, server requirements and post editors. However, the blogger must also consider other factors such as cost and versatility. Many blogging software packages are available free of charge while there are some which are available for purchase. The blogger will have to decide whether or not it is worthwhile to purchase a software package or whether free software packages will meet his blogging needs. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAfter considering software criteria and cost, the blogger should consider viewing sample blogs created using a particular software package.

The amount of revenue generated by a blog featuring affiliate marketing links may vary significantly depending on the amount of traffic the blog receives as well as the compensation offered for the affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing essentially entails creating a link on the blog to another company’s website. The other company then compensates the blog owner according to a previously agreed upon contract. This compensation may be awarded in a number of different ways. The blog owner may be compensated each time the advertisement is served, each time a unique website visitor clicks through the advertisement or each time a blog visitor performs a desired action such as making a purchase or registering with the website. This article will discuss some aspects of affiliate marketing which bloggers should understand including selecting opportunities carefully, maximizing the income potential for these opportunities and understanding the requirements associated with these affiliate marketing opportunities. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSelecting Affiliate Marketing Opportunities\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere is a wide variety of affiliate marketing opportunities available. Many different companies and websites offer affiliate marketing opportunities. In most cases the blog owner simply needs to submit the website address of his blog along with some other basic information for approval. In most cases the company is not likely to reject the application unless the content of the website is deemed to be objectionable or otherwise in conflict of interest with the company’s goals. However, although getting approved to display affiliate links on your website is a rather simple process, this does not mean blog owners should select these affiliate marketing opportunities without discretion. It is a far better idea to carefully select affiliate marketing opportunities with companies who are of interest to the target audience of the blog.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA well focused blog that is reaching a specific target audience should seek to display marketing links directing website traffic to companies which complement the blog without acting as direct competition to the blog. This helps to ensure the blog visitors will not only be interested in the affiliate marketing links and therefore more likely to click on the links but will also help to ensure the blog visitors do not find the affiliate marketing links to be bothersome. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMaximizing Affiliate Marketing Opportunities\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce blog owners have selected affiliate marketing opportunities it is time to consider how they can maximize the profit generated by these links. There are a couple of critical factors which blog owners should carefully consider to help maximize their profit from affiliate marketing. This includes regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the affiliate links and promoting the blog to maximize traffic.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBlog owners who incorporate affiliate marketing into their blog should regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the affiliate links. This can be done by comparing the percentage of blog visitors who click on the affiliate links to the overall blog traffic. A blog which has high traffic but a relatively small percentage of visitors who click on the affiliate links should consider making changes to attempt to entice more blog visitors to click on the links. These changes can involve the aesthetics, size or location of the advertisements. Making only one change at a time is recommended because it makes it easier for the blog owner to evaluate which changes are most beneficial. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBlog owners can also help to maximize the profit from their affiliate marketing opportunities by doing self promotion to drive additional website to the blog. This will likely be beneficial because higher website traffic will generally translate to greater profit from affiliate marketing. Additionally, the blog owner may want to occasionally mention companies for which they are an affiliate to generate interest in the advertisements on the website.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eUnderstanding Affiliate Marketing Requirements\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFinally, blog owners should pay careful attention to the affiliate marketing agreements they enter. This is important because some companies may place restrictions on the usage of a link to their website. This may include restrictions such as avoiding objectionable content, not including links or advertisements for direct competitors or restrictions on the appearance of the affiliate links. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in the blog losing affiliate privileges and the blog owner being denied compensation.

PPC is also one of the most cost-effective ways of targeted internet advertising. According to Forbes magazine, PPC or Pay Per Click, accounts to 2 billion dollars a year and is expected to increase to around 8 billion dollars by the year 2008. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet us take a quick look at how PPC Search Engines work. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese engines create listings and rate them based on a bid amount the website owner is willing to pay for each click from that search engine. Advertisers bid against each other to receive higher ranking for a specific keyword or phrase. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe highest bidder for a certain keyword or phrase will then have the site ranked as number 1 in the PPC Search Engines followed by the second and third highest bidder, up to the last number that have placed a bid on the same keyword or phrase. Your ads then will appear prominently on the results pages based on the dollar amount bid you will agree to pay per click.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHow do you make money by using PPC into your affiliate marketing business?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMost affiliate programs only pay when a sale is made or a lead delivered after a visitor has clickthrough your site. Your earnings will not always be the same as they will be dependent on the web site content and the traffic market.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe reason why you should incorporate PPC into your affiliate marketing program is that earnings are easier to make than in any other kind of affiliate program not using PPC. This way, you will be making profit based from the clickthroughs that your visitor will make on the advertiser’s site. Unlike some programs, you are not paid per sale or action.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePPC can be very resourceful of your website. With PPC Search Engines incorporated into your affiliate program, you will be able to profit from the visitor’s who are not interested in your products or services. The same ones who leave your site and never comes back.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou will not only get commissions not only from those who are just searching the web and finding the products and services that they wanted but you will be able to build your site’s recognition as a valuable resource. The visitors who have found what they needed from you site are likely to come back and review what you are offering more closely. Then they will eventually come back to search the web for other products. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis kind of affiliate program is also an easy way for you to generate some more additional revenues. For example, when a visitor on your site does a search in the PPC Search Engine and clicks on the advertiser bided listings, the advertisers’ account will then be deducted because of that click. With this, you will be compensated 30% to 80% of the advertisers’ bid amount.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePPC is not only a source of generating easy profits; it can also help you promote your own site. Most of the programs allow the commissions received to be spent for advertising with them instantly and with no minimum earning requirement. This is one of the more effective ways to exchange your raw visitors for targeted surfers who has more tendencies to purchase your products and services. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat will happen if you when you integrate PPC into your affiliate program?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePPC usually have ready-to-use affiliate tools that can be easily integrated into your website. The most common tools are search boxes, banners, text links and some 404-error pages. Most search engines utilize custom solutions and can provide you with a white-label affiliate program. This enables you, using only a few lines of code, to integrate remotely-hosted co-branded search engine into your website. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe key benefits? Not only more money generated but also some extra money on the side. Plus a lifetime commissions once you have referred some webmaster friends to the engine.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThink about it. Where can you get all these benefits while already generating some income for your site? Knowing some of the more useful tools you can use for your affiliate program is not a waste of time.

If so, you may want to think about having your bathroom remodeled.  You will find that are, literally, an unlimited number of benefit to doing so.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOnce of you have decided to have your bathroom remodeled, you will need to make a number of other decisions.  One of those decisions is how you would like to have your bathroom remodeled. Your two choices are doing it yourself or hiring the services of a professional contractor.  If you are like many other homeowners, you may want to have your bathroom professionally remodeled, but you may also be wondering whether or not it is a good idea. To determine whether or not you should have your bathroom professionally remodeled, you will want to examine the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePerhaps, the biggest advantage to having your bathroom professionally remodeled is the end result.  It is known fact that most professional contractors produce better work than most do it yourselfers.  Therefore, if you are looking to have the best looking bathroom on your block, it may be a good idea to hire the services of a professional contractor. In addition to better results, you may find that a professionally remodeled bathroom may help to increase the overall value of your home.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother one of the reasons why you may want to have your bathroom professionally remodeled is if you do not have the time to do it yourself. In addition to producing quality work, most professional contractors are able to get their work done in a fairly decent amount of time. This is where their previous experience comes in handy.  If your remodeling needs to be completed by a certain time, a deadline, you may want to hire the services of a professional contractor.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn addition to saving time, you may also want to hire the services of a professional contractor if you do not want to have the responsibility of remodeling your own bathroom.  A bathroom remodeling project is a large amount of work, especially if you are looking to have every inch of your bathroom remodeled.  Your responsibilities will not only include deciding what you want remodeled, but the fixtures that you would like to have replaced and so on. For instance, if you are looking to replace your bathroom toilet, you will need to buy a new bathroom toilet and then install it.  For someone inexperienced in home improvement, this can be a lot of work and responsibility; in fact it may just be too much.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlthough there are a number of advantages to having a professional contractor remodel your bathroom, there are also a number of disadvantages.  Perhaps, the biggest disadvantage is the cost. As previously mentioned, professional contractors are more likely to produce quality work.  If you are looking for the best, you should be prepared to pay for it.  That is why it can get quite expensive to have your bathroom professionally remodeled.  The overall costs of remodeling will all depend on how much remodeling you need to have done, as well as who you hire to do the remodeling.  \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnother disadvantage to having a professional contractor perform your kitchen remodeling is the lack of freedom that you may have.  When a contractor first starts their work, they will do as they are told; however, you may encounter a problem. Whether you decide to add on extra work or eliminate work, you may find that changing your mind costs extra money, in the form of labor and materials.  If you are unsure as to exactly what you would like your bathroom remodeling project to entail, it may be a good idea to make up your mind first or do your own remodeling work.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSince there are a number of advantages and disadvantages to having your bathroom professionally remodeled, you may find it difficult to make a decision. Perhaps, the best way to make that decision is to determine what your wants and needs are.  Taking the time to thoroughly examine all of your options, instead of rushing to make a decision, is the best way to ensure that you get exactly what you want, as well as what you need."},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/6857677810097834582"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/6857677810097834582"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https://ar23z.blogspot.com/2018/10/should-you-hire-professional-to-remodel.html","title":"Should You Hire a Professional to Remodel Your Bathroom?"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Admin"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"35","height":"35","src":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA\u003ds35"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1674710821049047417.post-3713124866866322306"},"published":{"$t":"2018-08-30T16:48:00.000+07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2019-04-22T18:59:13.641+07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Review"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"2018 Chevrolet Suburban Review on Specs and Features"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"A large family, at least with three or four kids, needs a large vehicle  as well.

As an inventor, you think you achieved something big, and your idea will help solve many daily life problems. But, what if you discover that the idea is already patented? It feels like you are hit by a brick wall, and all your money and efforts go in vain. What to do now? But, don't worry! You still have many IP monetization options which I have tried to cover in this article.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFirst, do as much research on your idea as you can, identify all the patents related to it, and check how many are active now. This is because most of the inventors and large corporations only focus on getting patents, but don't know the right commercialization strategy. Some of them try, but fail. As a result, they end up abandoning their patents. There is a good example of this below:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCatherine Hettinger invented a small toy for her daughter 2 decades ago, and obtained a patent for it. She took her idea to many toy manufacturers, but couldn't find a commercialization partner. As a result, she abandoned her patent. Later, the idea was picked by many Chinese companies, which developed its modern versions, and earned a lot of money. The name of the product is \"Fidget Spinner\", which become popular among children and even adults in 2017. You might have heard about it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat if your idea has active patents? You still don't have to worry. Check the IP protection area, and there can be two scenarios:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e1. Idea has active patents in a foreign country/region\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA patent is a territorial right applicable in the country/region in which it is granted. If you find patents on your idea in a foreign country/region only, you are free to use their technologies, build commercialization strategy, manufacture, market and distribute products in your country/region. But, when the patent holders expand the protection areas to your region, you must obtain license for the patent family you are using.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e2. Idea has active patents in your country/region\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you discovered active patents for your idea exist in your country/region, don't throw up your hands! You still have chances to utilize your idea. May be your idea has some advanced features, which are absent in the patented ones. May be the patents are not brought in the market you want to target or the inventors tried, but failed. Thus, you can turn those unused patents into successful products using an exclusive IP strategy.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eDo a comprehensive study on all the elements of your idea, and different segments and market verticals of the claims of the patents. If you get some unique elements, do market research, develop them further, and file the IP application.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat if the patents are successful, and inventors are selling products. That still doesn't stop you. Do a deep study on the products and technologies behind them, and see what extra features you can add. Prepare models of the modified versions of the products, set up meetings with the inventors, and you can have the opportunity to become part of successful businesses."},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/9187006650110664634"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/9187006650110664634"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Admin"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"35","height":"35","src":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA\u003ds35"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1674710821049047417.post-3659211273428063060"},"published":{"$t":"2018-08-27T22:37:00.001+07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2019-04-21T15:48:56.170+07:00"},"app$control":{"xmlns$app":"http://purl.org/atom/app#","app$draft":{"$t":"yes"}},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Web Hosting"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Tips to Choose the Best Bussiness Web Hosting Platform"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"Are you thinking of taking your business to more potential customers rather than confining to the walls of the shop? Websites are the fastest and easiest way to reach a larger crowd. But to start and maintain one, you should approach a business web hosting company.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhether you own a big business or your business budget is low, creating your own online platform is considered as the basic promotion nowadays. Most of the potential customers love to shop at home, where they can get their needs delivered to their doorsteps. So the website plays a vital role in the growth of your business and to get great customer satisfaction you should maintain them properly. This job is done by a business web hosting company.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWeb hosting is a service provider for your website, where they store and maintain your files, documents, etc. There are diversified options for selecting a web hosting for your business. But basic thing to keep in mind is the type of business you own. Whether you own a big business and can afford good budget web hosting or you are in need of a more affordable choice. Also, consider what you expect your website to provide your customers with.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCommonly found types of web hosting are; shared, dedicated, VPS and cloud hosting.

But before you go on experimenting with this and that setup you have to realize a couple of things about positioning.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe first thing you should know is that there is no universal position that is guaranteed to improve your earnings. That being said, the part above about experimenting is meant to be taken literally. You have to try as many setups as you can to find the solution with the greatest benefit.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut, of course certain places usually work better then others. Of course, Google recognizes this and they publish a \"heat map\" of how much revenue ads placed in certain portions of the page can bring you. Experimenting is often the best way you can find, what suits the sub conscious mind of your audience.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGenerally the most profitable ads are placed within the main content, generally right above it. But this is by no means a rule and there are some exceptions to it. One known exception is having a news site or something similar to a new site. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf this is your case, you will often find that you generate more earnings by placing your ads at the bottom of the content, right before comments begin. This is because as users finish reading a story, they have a short moment where they're looking for something more to do. And your AdSense ads can offer them that something.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlso, placing ads to the left side of your page seems to work better almost all the time. Of course, this is logical because text is generally written from left to right (unless you come from certain countries where it's the other way around). \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePeople will finish a sentence and return their eyes to the left position, which means they have a higher chance of spotting your ads.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlso, there's a bit more to this then just having ads visually in the right place. If you have more then one ad you have to worry about where they're located in the code as well. And there's a very good reason for this concern.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAdSense fills the ads in the order it finds them in the source. That means that if the first add you have in the code isn't the one generating the highest revenue, you may soon start to lose money, rather then earn more. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is because if AdSense doesn't have anymore ads it will supplement your space with public service ads or just leave it blank altogether. That means that, if you're unlucky, you could end up with your most profitable locations not having any good ads at all. To supplement your revenues \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere are other issues with how many ads you should place in your site. The problem is that if you have too many, rather then generate more income, you'll have a lower click through rate, as visitors tend not to follow ads from the places where these come in excess.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYou have to constantly keep track of how the users interact with your site. Keep an eye out for where the visitors will be looking at your site most. This is generally the place where you want to use your first ads. Also try not to place ads in annoying positions as that can guarantee a lower click through rate.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOf course, you always need to have ads that blend in with your content and generally don't make the visitor's presence on your site an unpleasant one. The key is providing an enjoyable experience for your visitor, whilst generating revenues from their exploration. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd again, ultimately the best revenue will be earned through a lot of experimentation. Be sure to use AdSense's channels feature and be on the look out for how certain ads in your pages are doing whilst altering the positions to better supplement your earnings."},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/6774291792103038247"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/6774291792103038247"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Admin"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"35","height":"35","src":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA\u003ds35"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1674710821049047417.post-3721728736613356015"},"published":{"$t":"2018-08-27T22:30:00.001+07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2019-04-21T15:48:56.302+07:00"},"app$control":{"xmlns$app":"http://purl.org/atom/app#","app$draft":{"$t":"yes"}},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Finance"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"How You \u0026 Your Partner Should Save Money"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"Most newly-married couples are having a hard time adjusting to a different way of life, especially when it comes to financial matters.

Dulu bagaimana kamu memahami ajaran Islam?\" Alloh tidak bertanya kepada kita tentang pendapat para ulama, kyai atau madzhab apa pun juga. Karena itu kita jangan sibuk dengan pendapat ulama, kyai ataupun madzhab.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eKita wajib berusaha sendiri memahami Islam dengan kemampuan yang ada pada diri kita masing-masing. Ya, sejauh kita mampu dengan peralatan kemampuan yang kita miliki. Bukan dengan kebodohan. Bila saudara ingin mempelajari Al-Qur'an, maka harus paham bahasa arab. Karena itu saudara harus belajar bahasa arab. Bagaimana anda memahami Al-Qur'an, bila tidak mengerti bahasa arab? Karena itu wajib bagi kita untuk mempelajari\u0026nbsp; bahasa arab, \u003ci\u003efardhu 'ain\u003c/i\u003e. Sebatas mana kita wajib mempelajari bahasa arab itu? Minimal untuk keperluan memahami pokok-pokok kewajiban agama.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eApakah kita wajib mempelajari Al-Qur'an dan hadis Nabi SAW sepanjang hayat? Ya! Dan kewajiban ini kita lakukan berangsur-angsur. Hari ini kita pelajari ini dan besok kita pelajari lainnya. Apakah dengan cara demikian, kebenaran yang kita peroleh tidak berubah-ubah? Kebenarannya tidak berubah-ubah, tetapi yang berubah adalah pemahaman kita. Al-Qur'an tetap seperti apa adanya. Jadi bukan kebenarannya yang berubah. Pendapat kita yang bisa berubah, sedangkan kebenaran Al-Qur'an tetap sama, Sejak diturunkan sampai kelak kemudian hari. Lalu, kita beragama Islam itu apakah berdasarkan kebenaran atau berdasarkan pendapat kita? Berdasarkan Al-Qur'an! Sedangkan kita diperintahkan untuk memahaminya.Ini berarti setiap orang diberi hak menerapkan pemahamannya sendiri. Walupun pendapat kita itu mungkin salah, tetapi tidak berdosa. Tingkat kemampuan kita akan ditolerir oleh Alloh. Kemampuan kita apa adanya, itulah yang wajib kita pergunakan. Kita tidak boleh ikut-ikutan. Oleh karena itu, banyak kasus perbedaan pendapat para sahabat di masa hayat Nabi SAW. Dikonfirmasikan kepada Nabi SAW contoh konkret tentang tayamum.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eDari Ammar bin Yasir, ia berkata: \"Nabi SAW mengutus aku untuk suatu urusan, sedang saya dalam keadaan junub, tetapi tidak mendapatkan air. Lalu aku berguling di atas tanah sebagaimana binatang berguling. Kemudian saya datang kepada Nabi SAW dan aku ceritakan yang demikian itu maka sabdanya: 'Cukup buat engkau hanya berbuat dengan dua tanganmu begini, kemudian ia tepukkan kedua tangannya ke tanah satu kali, lalu ia sapukan tangan kirinya pada tangan kanannya dan pada punggung kedua tapak tangannya, lalu mukanya.'\" {H.R Nasa'i}\u003cbr /\u003eIni adalah contoh dari upaya seorang sahabat dalam memahami perintah tayamum. Ayat tayamum termaktub dalam surat An-Nisa' ayat 43 dan surat Al-Maidah ayat 6: \"Bila kamu tidak menemukan air, maka tayamumlah kamu!\". Tayamum adalah bersuci dengan debu.\u003cbr /\u003eAmar bin Yasir berbuat terlebih dulu sejauh pemahamannya, kemudian Rasulullah memberikan contoh begini dan begitu. Tindakan seperti itu tidak disalahkan oleh Rasulullah. Itulah pemahaman Amar bin Yasir terhadap ayat tayamum, dan itu sudah sah karena sebatas itulah kemampuan dia. Kalau nanti ternyata apa yang ia pahami itu keliru, maka kekeliruannya itu tidak membawa dosa. Kalau di kemudian hari ia tahu yang benar, maka ia ikut kebenaran itu. Jadi tidak ada sikap menunggu. Diri kita masing-masing harus aktif kita tidak boleh beralasan: \"Saya akan bertanya dulu kepada Ulama atau kyai.\" \"Tidak usah! Detik itu diperkirakan dan dicari dalam Al-Qur'an dan Hadits. Setelah ketemu, lalu dijalankan. Bila kemudian ternyata salah, diubah. Jadi tidak boleh ikut-ikutan. Ketika mendapati persoalan, pikirkan sendiri dan dicari dalam Al-Qur'an dan Hadits, bukan mengikuti pendapat Ulama atau Kyai.\u003cbr /\u003eDan untuk membetulkan pemahaman kita, maka kita diskusikan dengan orang yang lebih ahli. Dasar pijakannya kembali kepada Al-Qur'an dan Hadits. Jadi, kita harus selalu membaca Al-Qur'an dan Hadits untuk mencari tahu. Tidak boleh berhenti. Kita harus berbuat semampu kita. Bila belum tahu cara sholat, maka belajar lebih dahulu. Ketika sudah tahu tata caranya, maka tata caranya itu yang dikerjakan. KIta harus terus belajar, tidak hanya dengan melihat orang lalu ikut-ikutan, tetapii harus betul-betul dali yang ada di dalam Al-Qur'an dan Hadits.\u003cbr /\u003eKalu kita tahu pada hari ini, maka hari ini juga dikerjakan. Kita tidak boleh berhenti sampai hari ini, tetapi harus sampai 'Z' (selesai-red). Baca Al-Qur'an tiap hari, tidak boleh ada waktu lowong, meskipun satu ayat, membaca dalil dari Al-Qur'an dan Hadits itu wajib. Pahamilah Islam, Minimal kita mendengarkan orang yang membaca Al-Qur'an dan Hadits sendiri sesuai kemampuan.\u003cbr /\u003eAl-Qur'an yang 30 juz harus kita pelajari setiap hari. tak boleh satu ayatpun yang kita abaikan atau tinggalkan. Seandainya da seseorang yang baru tahu Sholat setelah dia melihat, lalu dia ikut-ikutan sholat, tanpa mau belajar secara benar, maka dia berdosa. Itu namanya taklid. sekalipun yang diikutinya seorang kyai, tetapi dia berdosa. Dia harus tahu atau belajar setiap tata cara sholat dengan bersumberkan pada Hadist Nabi SAW. Alloh tidak akan menerima ibadah orang dengan cara taklid.\u003cbr /\u003eKalau orang taklid tentu tidak memperoleh pahala. Boleh jadi ia salah peniruannya, jadi berdosa. Karena itu, taklid kepada kyai atau ulama tidak boleh. Berpikirlah sendiri, sekalipun boleh jadi salah. Sekiranya seorang kyai berkata; \"Pintar mana saya dengan kamu? Kamu tidak bisa membaca kitab 'kuning', sedang saya mampu!\"\u003cbr /\u003eKatakanlah kepadanya; \"Pak kyai! Kita diperintah oleh Alloh untuk mengikuti Al-Qur'an dan Hadits Nabi, bukan mengikuti pendapat ulama atau kyai!\"\u003cbr /\u003eKalau begitu, apa syarat berijtihad itu? Punya pengetahuan dan ilmu mengenai persoalan yang dihadapi. Masalah tayamum, maka anda harus tahu Ayat tentang tayamum. Jadi syarat berijtihad adalah tahu persoalan yang kita hadapi. Tifak harus tahu 100 ayat, baru boleh berijtihad. Bila satu ayat atau Hadits yang kita ketahui, maka satu Ayat dan Hadits itu kita pikirkan dengan sungguh-sungguh.\u003cbr /\u003eKalau tidak tahu Ayat atau Haditsnya, maka jangan dikerjakan. Kalau ternyata kita mengerjakan sesuatu tanpa tahu dalilnya berarti kita taklid dan taklid itu dosa.\u003cbr /\u003eSyarat berijtihad secara professional adalah tahu Ushul Fiqih, bahasa Arab, ilmu Hadits dan ilmu Al-Qur'an. Kalu sahabat Rosululloh SAW, mereka telah mengerti semua itu. Akan tetapi kita sekarang, harus memenuhi ilmu-ilmu tersebut untuk dapat berijtihad dengan sempurna.\u003cbr /\u003eOrang yang berijtihad adalah orang yang tahu persoalan. Kalau tidak tahu apa yang diperijtihadkan? Kalau berijtihad secara professional tidak tahu ilmu-ilmu alatnya, laksana tukang becak membedah mayat. Maka seseorang berijtihad tanpa tahu ilmu pirantinya, ia berdosa. Apapun yang kita lakukan dengan kebodohan, adalah berdosa. Dalam urusan apaun, tidak hanya dalam persoalan agama, urusan duniapun bila kita lakukan dengan kebodohan, berdosa. Contoh: Ada seseorang yang terluka. Karena dianggap luka biasa saja, lalu diberi bensin. Tahu-tahu kejang, lalu mati. Apakah hal seperti itu tidak berdosa? Contoh lain; Seseorang mersasa demam menggigil, lalu dia minum bodrex. Malamnya meninggal dunia. Karena apa? Ternyata ada kontra indikasi antara obat yang diminum dengan penyakitnya. Setelah meninggal, kemudian diperiksa oleh dokter. Lalu dokter menyatakan, bahwa dia keracunan. Perbuatan semacam ini adalah bunuh diri dan berdosa. Ada orang lain yang menanyakan bagaimana hukum semacam itu?\u003cbr /\u003e\"Orang seperti itu berarti bunuh diri.\"\u003cbr /\u003e\"Bukankah dia tidak tahu?\"\u003cbr /\u003e\"Justru karena kebodohannya melakukan hal yang berbahaya, maka menjadi lebih berat bagi dirinya. Mengapa dia mengobati dirinya dengan cara kebodohan??\"\u003cbr /\u003eOleh karena itu kita tidak boleh sembarangan. Bila kita tidak tahu, maka kita wajib menanyakannya kepada ahlinya. Jangan dengan seenaknya melakukan sesuatu sebelum kita tahu dengan benar. Karena itu, seseorang yang mengajarkan sesuatu ilmu yang belum dia ketahui, maka hukumnya berdosa. Orang tidak tahu ilmu tajwid, lalu mengajari tajwid, sehingga orang yang diajarinya salah terus dalam membaca Al-Qur'an. Orang seperti itu berdosa dan dengan menanggung dosa sebanyak orang yang mengikuti kesalahannya.\u003cbr /\u003eSeseorang yang dikatakan ahli itu bagaimana? Apakah pengetahuannya tentang sesuatu itu harus diakui oleh oleh orang lain atau tidak? Ya, bila seseorang dikatakan oleh pihak lain yang tahu tentang masalah tersebut sebagai ahlinya, maka dia adalah orang yang ahli. Misalnya seorang ahli obat-obatan menilai apakah orang itu ahli atau tidak? Kalau para ahlinya mengakui, maka hal itu dapat diterima.\u003cbr /\u003eSeseorang diketahui sebagai ilmu ahli ilmu Al-Qur'an. Bagaimana orang-orang yang selam ini diakui sebagai diakui sebagi ahli Al-Qur'an, mengakui dia ataukah tidak? Kalau tidak mengakui, maka dia bukan ahli.\u003cbr /\u003eBagaiman bila seseorang sudah sangat kritis, sedangkan untuk bertanya kepada ahlinya jaraknya sangat jauh, kira-kira 30 kilometer? Bukankah orang ini tidak ada kesempatan bertanya? Keadaan semacam ini adalah kondisi darurat. Dia boleh berpikir dan mengatasi persoalannya dengan kemampuannya sendiri.\u003cbr /\u003eKasus sahabat diatas adalah kasus yang konkrit. Mereka tahu Ayat AL-Qur'an, lalu berijtihad. Misalnya mengerjakan sholat, tanpa tahu tuntunan Rosululloh, hanya ikut-ikutan sholat. Kita diajari seseorang sholat, tanpa menerangkan haditsnya. Kita wajib bertanya: \"Pak! Saya sholat disuruh membaca Al-Fatihah itu tuntunannya dari mana?\"\u003cbr /\u003eBagaimana kalau orang awam? JAdi orang awam pun tetap wajib bertanya dan kita wajib mengajari kritis. Seenaknnya saja berbuat, berdosa. Karena itu kita diperintahkan Alloh menggunakan akal. Tidak ada alasan bagi manusia menjadi orang bodoh. Kita semua wajib kritis. Orang awam yang menganggap pak kyai adalah orang serba tahu, serba benar, adalah sikap syirik, \"Bukankah pak kyai yang menyampaikan pelajaran juga berdasarkan kitab?\"\u003cbr /\u003eDiatas sudah dijelaskan, orang-orang yang ikut-ikutan berarti telah berbuat syirik? Mengikuti kyai yang menyampaikan pelajaran agam tanpa dalil adalah taklid, ikut-ikutan. Bila pak kyai menunjukkan ayat Al-Qur'an, atau Haditsnya, maka kitapun tetap waji bersikap kritis, tidak hanya membeo saja. Bila pak kyai ternyata tidak menunjukkan ayat Al-Qur'an atau Haditsnya, maka mengikuti hal seperti itu dinamakan taklid. Dan taklid itu haram hukumnya.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\"separator\" style\u003d\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eEak9-446UQ/U7fJ1pQkB2I/AAAAAAAAAVQ/4PelZiNqp7Y/s1600/sasak.jpg\" imageanchor\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"\u003e\u003cimg border\u003d\"0\" src\u003d\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eEak9-446UQ/U7fJ1pQkB2I/AAAAAAAAAVQ/4PelZiNqp7Y/s1600/sasak.jpg\" height\u003d\"267\" width\u003d\"400\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/7472560996362366167"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1674710821049047417/posts/default/7472560996362366167"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Admin"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"35","height":"35","src":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA\u003ds35"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eEak9-446UQ/U7fJ1pQkB2I/AAAAAAAAAVQ/4PelZiNqp7Y/s72-c/sasak.jpg","height":"72","width":"72"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1674710821049047417.post-5122821453450854046"},"published":{"$t":"2013-08-02T21:20:00.000+07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2019-02-07T02:39:45.461+07:00"},"app$control":{"xmlns$app":"http://purl.org/atom/app#","app$draft":{"$t":"yes"}},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Pengetahuan"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Aqidah"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"BUKAN HASIL PENGALAMAN SEJARAH"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e{(Rasul itu) berkata: \"Apakah (kamu akan mengikutinya juga) sekalipun aku membawa untukmu (agama) yang lebih (nyata) memberi petunjuk daripada apa yang kamu dapati bapak-bapakmu menganutnya?\" Mereka menjawab: \"Sesungguhnya kamu mengingkari agama yang kamu diutus untuk menyampaikannya.\"} Az-Zukhruf (43) Ayat 24\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca name\u003d'more'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eIslam bukan hasil perjuangan \u0026nbsp;seorang atau suatu bangsa.
